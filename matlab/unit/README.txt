Welcome to the University of Newcastle Identification Toolbox
(UNIT). This is release 4.0, March 2013 for Matlab. 

This release includes features for: 

1. Handling non-regularly sampled continuous time data via continous
time model structures;

2. Support for grey-box model model structures;

3. Support for arbitrary parametrization of state-space model
structures;

4. Support for general non-linear model structures via particle
filtering routines.

To get started the user may be interested in browsing the available 
screencasts at:

http://sigpromu.org/idtoolbox/screencasts.html

Additionally, the document

unit.pdf 

in this directory provides a very brief overview of some aspects of the 
toolbox functions and usage. 

Otherwise, to run the GUI just type 

est

at the Matlab command prompt. A tutorial is availble by clicking "Help" 
in the menu bar and selecting "Tutorial". 

Alternatively, command line routines are demonstrated by typing

demo_unit

at the Matlab command window and then choose from a number of
demonstrations. At the completion of each demo, the user is given
a choice of either returning to another demo selection (default) or
entering the MATLAB workspace.  The latter is terminated 
by typing:

return 

at the command prompt.  This will cause the demo page to re-appear and
further demonstrations can then be run.

If the user is interested in further detail for each demonstration
then the respective .m files can be viewed in a text editor where
comments explaining the various commands are provided.

Please email either 

Brett Ninness (Brett.Ninness@newcastle.edu.au)

if you have any questions regarding the toolbox.
