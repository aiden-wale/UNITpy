# This function calls underlying gradient-based search algorithms, based on
# the type of model and type of data passed in. As new models and data
# types are incorporated into the toolbox, this function would expand to
# cater for these new categories if appropriate.
#
# The procedure is to identify which model type is being used
# (M.type), and then to identify what data type is available (Z.type), and
# then to set the cost_fun variable to point to the corresponding cost
# function for this model/data combination.
